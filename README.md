Welcome to my movie list application. 
Today's date is June 19, 2025

This application allows you to add a movie to the watchlist. 

The user can also delete movies from the list as well as search for a movie in the list

Added functionality allows the user to exit out of search by clicking the show all movies button

In addition, a test has been added to ensure a duplicate movie is not being added

Possible future enhancements:

//-add sorting by rating or release date
